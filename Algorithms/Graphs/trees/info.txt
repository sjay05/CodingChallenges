Trees:

- Connected, acyclic graph that consists of n nodes and n-1 edges.

- Removing an edge divides it into 2 components, and adding edge
creates cycle.

- "Leaf" nodes are nodes with degree (1) - one neighbor.

- In a "rooted" tree, one node is appointed root of tree. 
    - The children of a node are its lower neighbors, and parent
    is upper neighbor.
