/*
Postorder Traversal on Trees:

Traversal Instructions:
1) Traverse left subtree recursively
2) Traverse right subtree recursively
3) Access current node (visit root)

Uses/Applications/Facts:

1) This traversal can be used to delete
node in a tree the right way because
both (left) and (right) subtrees are deleted
before deleting root node.
