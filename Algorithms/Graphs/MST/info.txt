A "spanning tree" of a graph consits of all nodes and some edges (not all). 
It is built so that there is a path between any two nodes, and the tree
is acyclic. 

The "weight" of a spanning tree is the sum of its edge weights. A "minimum" 
spanning tree is a spanning tree whose weight is as small as possible. 
There is also "maximum" spanning tree such that the weight is as large as 
possible. 

A graph might have multiple minimum and maximum spanning trees.

There are two algorithms to process the edges of the graphs to generate
minimum spanning trees:

    1) Kruskal's Algorithm
    2) Prim's Algorithm
