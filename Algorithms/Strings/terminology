Terms for String Algorithms:

1) Substring 
    Ex. "ABCD" - A, B, C, D, AB, BC, CD...
    String of length (n) has n(n+1)/2 substrings

2) Subsequence
    Ex. "ABCD" - A, B, C, D, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD...
    String of length (n) has 2^n - 1 Subsequences

3) Prefix
    Substring that starts at the beginning:
    Ex. "ABCD" - A, AB, ABC, ABCD

4) Suffix
    Substring that ends at the end:
    Ex. "ABCD" - D, CD, BCD, ABCD

5) Rotation
    Moving characters from beginning to end one by one:
    Ex. "ABCD" - ABCD, BCDA, CDAB, DABC

6) Period
    A prefix that can reconstruct the full string by repeating,
    the last repeptition can be partial
    Ex. "ABCABCA" period = ABC
    bec: ABC + ABC + A (partial)

7) Border
    String that is prefix and suffix of string
    Ex. "ABCABCA' - A, ABA, ABACABA


TRIE STRUCTURE:
- Maintains set of strings starting from root.

                       /     \

                    [ A ]    [ E ]
