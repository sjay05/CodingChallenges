VOCABULARY AND DEFINITIONS:

Vertex/Node:
A vertex is a fundamental part of a graph. A vertex can also
have additional information. This information is
called the "payload".

Edge:
An edge connects two vertices to show that there
is a relationship between them. Edges can be
one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph
are all one-way, then the graph is called a
"directed" graph.

Weight:
Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost
to go from one vertex to another. For example in a
graph of roads that connect one city to another, the
weight on the edge might represent the distance
between two cities.
