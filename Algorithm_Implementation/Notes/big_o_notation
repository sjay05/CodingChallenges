O(log n), known as log time. EXAMPLE: BINARY SEARCH
O(n), known as linear time. EXAMPLE: SIMPLE SEARCH
O(n * log n), EXAMPLE: A FAST-SORTING ALGORITHM (QUICKSORT)
O(n^2), EXAMPLE: A SLOW-SORINT ALGORITHM (SELECTION SORT)
O(n!), EXAMPLE: A REALLY SLOW ALGORITHM (TRAVELING SALESMAN)

Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth
of the number of operations.
